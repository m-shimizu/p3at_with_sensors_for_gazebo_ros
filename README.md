# p3at_with_sensors_for_gazebo_ros
A p3at robot model with hokuyo and camera for using with gazebo_ros package.  

I prepared a p3at xacro file with camera and hokuyo for user of the gazebo_ros envronment, and prepared some sample launch files.  
Followings are descriptions of 3 launch files.  

 * p3at_RC2016.launch :
   A prototype launch file to spawn a p3at with hokuyo and camera on.  
RC2016VRL_event1.world.  

 * spawn_p3at_RC2016.launch  
   A launch file to spawn a p3at with an own robot name, pose (x, y, z, yaw).  

* empty_world_multi_robot_example_RC2016.launch  
   A demo launch file to spawn 4 p3at robots on RC2016VRL_event1.world.  

Before use them, please change the world filename "RC2016VRL_event1.world" with your favorite one in those sample launch files.  

Following steps are am example to use those launch files,  

1. Prepare ~/pioneer3at_ws by https://github.com/nkoenig/pioneer3at_demo .  
2. Do following command :  
    $ cd ~/pioneer3at_ws/src  
3. Extract attached pioneer3at_demo.zip here with overwriting .  
4. Do following commands :  
    $ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/RoboCupRescuePackage/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}  
    $ cd ~/pioneer3at_ws  
    $ catkin_make install  
    $ source ~/pioneer3at_ws/install/setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch p3at_description multi_robot_example_RC2016.launch  
5. Open another terminal.  
6. Do following command :  
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/robot1/cmd_vel  

Then you can see 4 p3at robots, and you can control robot1.  

If you want to use other world files, copy your wotld files into ~/pioneer3at_ws/src/pioneer3at_demo/p3at_gazebo/worlds/ .   
And change the value of "world_name"(currently it is "USARGazebo.world") with your world filename in the launch file.  
(Launch files are in ~/pioneer3at_ws/src/pioneer3at_demo/p3at_description/launch/)  
To change the location of spawning robots, please change values of pose_x, pose_y, pose_yaw of each robot.  
After changing, you need "catkin_make install" again.  

Let's hands on!
